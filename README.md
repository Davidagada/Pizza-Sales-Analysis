#### Pizza Sales Analysis - 2015

### Problem Statement
As we look to gain deeper insights into our pizza business, we need to focus on several key performance indicators (KPIs) that will help us make informed decisions. Below are the specific metrics I would like you to analyze and report on:
- Track the overall profitability of our pizza sales. We need to know not just the revenue but also the profit margins, factoring in the cost of ingredients, labor, and other operational expenses.
- Monitor the total number of pizzas sold over time. This will help us understand demand patterns and make inventory decisions.
- Determine which days of the week are most profitable and have the highest sales volume.
- Identify peak times for pizza orders, which will help us optimize staffing and marketing efforts.
- Understand the distribution of pizza sales across different sizes (small, medium, large, etc.)
- Drill down further into specific pizza varieties within each category to identify our best and worst performers.
- Track how sales fluctuate throughout the year.
